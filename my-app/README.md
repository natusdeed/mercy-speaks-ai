This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Setup API Key for Chatbot

The chatbot requires an Anthropic Claude API key to function. Follow these steps:

1. **Get your API key** from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. **Create a `.env.local` file** in the `my-app` directory (same level as `package.json`)
3. **Add your API key** to the file:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
   ```
4. **Restart your dev server** after adding the key

**Note:** The `.env.local` file is already in `.gitignore` and won't be committed to version control.

### Run the Development Server

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
